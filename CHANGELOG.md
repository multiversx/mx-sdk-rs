# Change Log

There are several crates in this repo, this changelog will keep track of all of them.

Check [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/) for recommendations on how to structure this file.

## [Unreleased]


## [elrond-wasm 0.13.0] - 2021-03-04
### Main feature
- Events revamped:
	- any event name of any length is accepted. The event name is now expressed as ASCII instead of hex
	- topics can have any length
	- topics and data are serialized using the elrond-codec instead of the old macro-based solution
	- old events are still allowed for now via the `#[legacy_event("0x...")]` syntax; might be removed in the future
### Refactoring 
- Major refactoring of elrond-wasm-derive. This doesn't change much of the functionality, though.
### Minor features
- SingleValueMapper redesigned for easier use. It no longer keeps the storage value cached.

## [elrond-wasm 0.12.0] - 2021-02-25
- Reorganized ESDT and EGLD direct send api.
- New async call syntax
	- redesigned contract proxies
	- contract calls are communicated via objects returned from endpoint methods
	- callbacks now specified programmatically
	- got rid of the `#[callback_arg]` annotation

## [elrond-wasm 0.11.0, elrond-codec 0.5.0, mandos 0.5.0] - 2021-02-05
### Refactor
- Major refactoring of the contract API: split into smaller traits
### Added
- Storage mappers:
	- LinkedListMapper
	- SetMapper
	- MapMapper
- SendApi
	- created SendApi, which groups all functionality related to sending tokens and interactions with other contracts
    - integrated the new TransferESDT hook from Arwen
    - added an unsafe buffer for handling values before transfer
    - mandos-rs fixes
    - contracts now use the new API + more mandos tests
- Call Value API refactor and `#[payable]` updates:
	- Main features:
    	- `#[payable]` annotation more versatile: `#[payable("EGLD")]` `#[payable("TOKEN-ID")]` `#[payable("*")]`
    	- `#[payable]` still accepted but throws a warning, will become unsupported in the future.
    	- `#[payment]` argument attribute now also provides ESDT payment where applicable
    	- a new TokenIdentifier type that encodes the EGLD special token and any ESDT token
    	- a new `#[token_identifier]` argument attribute provides the token id. Similar to `#[payment]` it is a fake argument, not exported.
    	- ABI updated ("payableInTokens" is no longer restricted to "EGLD")
    	- all new features covered by mandos tests
    	- async proxies still only accept `#[payable("EGLD")]`, but that is for future updates
	- Less visible changes:
    	- all call value hooks now grouped in a new CallValueApi
    	- for low-level access, developers now need to write self.call_value().egld_value(), etc.
    	- some optimizations in the handling of call value hooks
	- Refactoring:
    	- parse_attr mod was split into a proper folder with many files, since it had grown too large
    	- an extensive refactoring of elrond-wasm-derive not yet performed, will come soon
### Minor features
- ABI enum discriminants generation
### Fixed
- Crypto API fixes:
	- `keccak256:` prefix also supported in mandos
    - reorganized crypto mandos tests in basic-features
    - mandos-rs was accidentally providing keccak256 instead of sha256

## [elrond-wasm 0.9.0, elrond-codec 0.3.0, mandos 0.2.0] - 2020-11-04
- Serialization completely refactored to use "fast exit" methods

## [elrond-wasm 0.8.0, elrond-codec 0.2.0] - 2020-11-02
- Was the first version to split Encode/Decode into TopEncode/NestedEncode/TopDecode/NestedDecode
- Attempted to optimize the serializer to use "fast exit" closures. It worked, but the resulting bytecode size was not satisfactory. Even though it was completely replaced and never got to be used, it historically remains the solution of this release.
- Some of the storage/argument/result trait refactorings, survived.

- `sc-meta` improvements:
	- `overflow-checks` field in `sc-config.toml`;
	- Upgrade: new `--no-check` flag, which disables the compile check after major version upgrades;
	- Template: `wasm` crates no longer copied for new versions; retroactively patched missing `multiversx.json` file for older versions.

## [sc 0.45.1, codec 0.18.2] - 2023-11-24
- Fixed sc-meta standalone install backwards compatibility.
- Better hygiene in codec derive.

## [sc 0.43.0, codec 0.18.1, vm 0.5.0] - 2023-08-16
- Fixed a rustc compatibility issue when building contracts. The meta crate looks at the rustc version when generating the wasm crate code:
	- pre-rustc-1.71;
	- between rustc-1.71 and rustc-1.73;
	- latest, after rustc-1.73. Also upgraded some dependencies, notably proc-macro2 "1.0.66" and ed25519-dalek "2.0.0".
- Initial version of the contract template tool in multiversx-sc-meta:
	- Ability to download and adapt template contracts, to kickstart contract development;
	- A template mechanism that is customizable on the framework side;
	- Available templates: adder, empty, crypto-zombies.
- The Rust debugger is now thread safe.
- Removed the `big-float` feature of multiversx-sc, because the functionality is already available on mainnet.
- Arguments `--target-dir-wasm`, `--target-dir-meta`, and `--target-dir-all` in the `multiversx-sc-meta` CLI.
- Fixed an issue with contract calls and ESDT transfers in the `StaticApi` environment.

## [sc 0.42.0, codec 0.18.0, vm 0.4.0, scenario-format 0.20.0, sdk 0.2.0] - 2023-07-15
- Multi-endpoints in multi-contracts:
	- It is now possible to have multiple versions of the same endpoint in different multi-contract variants.
	- We can also have multiple versions of the constructor.
- Major architectural redesign of the debugger:
	- The VM executor interface inserted between the smart contract API objects and the Rust VM. A new `VMHooksApi` is used to connect on the smart contract side. A `VMHooksDispatcher` object and `VMHooksHandler` interface provide the connection on the VM side.
	- The `VMHooksApi` comes in several flavors (backends):
		- The old `DebugApi` is now only used at runtime, on the VM context stack;
		- A new `StaticApi` provides support for managed types in a regular context, without needing to be initialized;
		- An additional `SingleTxApi` is useful for unit tests. Aside managed types, it also allows some basic context for tx inputs, results, storage and block info.
	- Removed almost all of the legacy functionality from the smart contract APIs.
- System SC mock.
	- It is now possible to issue tokens (fungible, SFT, NFT) in integration tests.
	- Setting roles is modelled.
	- It is, however, not fully mocked.
- Integration of blackbox and whitebox testing into one unified framework.
	- Whitebox testing was the modus operandi of the old testing framework.
	- Integration of whitebox functionality into the new testing framework allows easier migration in some specific cases.
	- Tested the new whitebox framework with the old tests by injecting it into the implementation of the old one.
- Interactors can now export a trace of their execution, thus producing integration tests.
	- Integrated tool for retrieving the initial states of the involved accounts from the blockchain.
	- Tight integration with the scenario testing infrastructure makes generating the trace straightforward;
	- The same format for the trace is used, as in the case of the integration tests.
- Interactors can now execute several steps (calls, deploys) in parallel.
- Redesigned the wrappers around the Rust and Go JSON scenario executors;
	- Also improved the  `sc-meta test-gen` tool for auto-generating these wrappers.
	- Using the `ScenarioRunner` interface to abstract away the various backends used to run tests.
- Redesigned syntax of both the testing and the interactor (snippets) frameworks.
	- While the codebases are separate (the latter is async Rust), the names and arguments of the methods are the same, and both use the scenario infrastructure.
	- Methods that allow chaining scenario steps, while also processing results;
	- Added several defaults in the syntax, for more concise code;
	- Deprecated the old testing framework;
	- Updated all contract interactors and blackbox tests with the new syntax;
	- Upgraded the snippets generator to produce new syntax.

## [sc 0.41.3, vm 0.3.3] - 2023-06-19
- Bugfix on `ManagedBufferCachedBuilder`, involving large inputs.
- Explicit enum ABI: `OperationCompletionStatus` is now properly described in the ABI as an enum that gets serialized by name instead of discriminant.

## [sc 0.41.2, codec 0.17.2, vm 0.3.2] - 2023-06-09
- Releasing a new version of the codec, without the dependency to `wee_alloc`.

## [sc 0.41.1, vm 0.3.1] - 2023-05-15

## [sc 0.41.0, vm 0.3.0] - 2023-05-05
- Fixed compatibility with rustc v1.71.0.
- Allocator system:
	- Contracts can now choose their own allocator. This works in multi-contract contexts.
	- New allocators: `fail` (default), `static64k`, `leaking`.
	- Removed dependency to `wee_alloc`, but using it is still possible if the contract references it directly.
	- Contract call stack size is now configurable in `multicontract.toml`.
	- The 'panic with message' system now relies on managed buffers instead of on an allocator.
- Fixed BigUint bitwise operations in the debugger.
- When building contracts, an additional `.mxsc.json` file is created, which packs both the contract binary, the ABI, and some additional metadata.
- Refactor: reorganized the meta crate.
- Deprecated some legacy methods in the API wrappers.

## [sc 0.40.1, vm 0.2.1] - 2023-04-24
- Building contracts also triggers an EI check, which verifies compatibility with various VM versions. It currently only issues warnings.
- `ManagedVecItem` implementation for arrays.

## [sc 0.40.0, vm 0.2.0] - 2023-04-20
- Call value `egld_value` and `all_esdt_transfers` methods return `ManagedRef` instead of owned objects, because they are cached (to avoid accidental corruption of the underlying cache).

## [sc 0.39.8, vm 0.1.8] - 2023-03-29
- `multiversx-sc-meta` `test-gen` command: generates Rust integration tests based on scenarios present in the `scenarios` folder.

	- Bugfix: custom names in the main contract no longer crash the multi-contract build.
	- Bugfix: the `--mir` flag works correctly in `sc-meta all build`;
	- Multi-contract configs can now specify separate cargo features for individual contracts, for conditional compilation.

## [sc 0.39.5, vm 0.1.5] - 2023-02-06
- `multiversx-sc-meta` improvements:
	- Rust snippet generator fixes. The generator creates compilable code with appropriate argument types.
	- `local-deps` command: generates a report on the local depedencies of contract crates. Will explore indirect depdencies too.
	- Upgrade tool minor fix.

## [sc 0.39.4, vm 0.1.4] - 2023-01-26

## [sc 0.39.3, vm 0.1.3] - 2023-01-26
- `multiversx-sc-meta` improvements:
	- `upgrade` can handle crates as early as `0.28.0`;
	- `--ignore` flag for the `all` command: will ignore folders with given names, by default set to `target`;
	- `info` command, shows contracts and contract library crates with their respective framework versions;
	- `--mir` flag when building, also emits MIR files;
	- printing to console the build command.
- `BigUint` from `u128` conversion.

## [sc 0.39.2, vm 0.1.2] - 2023-01-19

- `migrateUserName` builtin function mock.

## [elrond-wasm 0.38.0, elrond-codec 0.16.0, mandos 0.18.0] - 2022-12-15
- `ContractCall` refactor. Building a contract call comes with harder compile-time constraints. This also reduces compiled code size.
- `ContractBase` supertrait can be now stated explicitly for contract and module traits.
- Debugger:
	- Callback payment is now set correctly.
	- Function names are represented internally as strings instead of bytes, which aids debugging.
- Removed the `ei-1-2` feature, which was guarding the newer VM functions. These functions are in the mainnet, so this feature is no longer needed.
- New utility functions: `self.send().esdt_local_burn_multi(...`, `self.blockchain().get_token_attributes(...)`.
- Updated all crates to Rust 2021.

## [elrond-wasm 0.37.0, elrond-codec 0.15.0] - 2022-12-09
- Multi-contract build system:
	- build system refactor;

	- Added `take` and `replace` methods for `SingleValueMapper`;
	- Implemented `Extend` trait for `UnorderedSetMapper`.

## [elrond-wasm 0.36.1] - 2022-11-01

## [elrond-wasm 0.34.0, elrond-codec 0.12.0, mandos 0.16.0, elrond-interact-snippets 0.1.0] - 2022-07-08
- Major refactor of the mandos-rs infrastructure.
	- High-level Mandos objects moved to elrond-wasm-debug;
	- The `mandos` crate no longer depends on `elrond-wasm-debug` (as originally intended and implemented);
	- Typed mandos contract call objects, for better call syntax.
	- More syntactic sugar for writing mandos calls.
- The first version of elrond-interact-snippets, which can be used to write short blockchain interactor programs.
	- The syntax relies on contract proxies to easily build calls.
	- Some of the infrastructure is shared with Mandos.
	- There is an example of such a interactor for the multisig contract.

## [elrond-wasm 0.33.1, mandos 0.15.1] - 2022-06-24
- CodecSelf for BigInt

## [elrond-wasm 0.33.0, mandos 0.15.0] - 2022-06-20
- Removed the data field for direct EGLD & ESDT transfers.
- Testing and debugging environment aligned with VM version 1.4.53.
- Call value and token data infrastructure additional cleanup.

## [elrond-wasm 0.32.0, mandos 0.14.0] - 2022-06-03
- VM new functionality added as part of the environment interface 1.2:
	- Fully managed functionality for elliptic curves (no allocator);
	- Fully managed cryptographic functions (no allocator);
	- More efficient printing of big ints and hex;
	- Functionality available by adding the `ei-1-2` flag to contracts.
- `BigFloat` functionality. Since the functionality is not yet deployed on mainnet, use flag `big-float` to use.
- Major refactoring of the call value mechanism:
	- `TokenIdentifier` now only refers to ESDT, for mixed EGLD+ESDT we have `EgldOrEsdtTokenIdentifier`.
	- `EsdtTokenPayment` now only refers to ESDT, for mixed EGLD+ESDT we have `EgldOrEsdtTokenPayment`.
	- Compact version for multi-transfer: `let [payment_a, payment_b, payment_c] = self.call_value().multi_esdt();`.
	- Explicit `single_esdt` vs. `single_fungible_esdt` vs. `egld_or_single_esdt` vs. `egld_or_single_fungible_esdt`.
	- Payment arguments are still supported, although discouraged. They always assume the EGLD+ESDT scenario.

- Cleanup in the callback mechanism and in the `SendApi`.
- `SparseArray` implementation.
- `UniqueIdMapper` - efficient storage mapper for holding unique values.
- The ABI also contains events.
- New standard module: `StakingModule`.


## [elrond-wasm 0.31.1, mandos 0.13.1] - 2022-05-04
- Bugfix - formatter single char issue.

## [elrond-wasm 0.31.0, elrond-codec 0.11.0, mandos 0.13.0] - 2022-05-02
- Improved formatter. Strings can be formatted similarly to the standard Rust ones, but without allocator, using managed buffers. Macros `require!`, `sc_panic!`, `sc_format!`, `sc_print!` use it.
- Removed build flag `ei-1-1`, following mainnet updated and new VM endpoints being available. Among others, managed `sha256` and `keccak256` APIs can be used freely.
- `CodecFrom` and `CodecInto` traits to define equivalent encodings and conversions via codec.
- Generated smart contract proxies use the `CodecFrom`/`CodecInto` traits to accept a wider range of types.
- Mandos Rust testing framework v2, which uses contract proxies for composing calls and is capable of building and exporting mandos scenarios.
- Managed type handle management system in the contract, to reduce the number of API calls to the VM. General VM API refactor.
- Eliminated `#[var_args]` annotation. The framework can now distinguish between single-values and multi-values solely based on type.
- Contract cleans up return data after performing synchronous calls. Getting return data by range is no longer needed and the respective methods have been removed.
- Fixed behavior of blockchain API `get_esdt_token_data`.
- Git tag/commit info in ABI (fixed & reintroduced).

## [elrond-wasm 0.30.0, elrond-codec 0.10.0] - 2022-03-17
- Feature flags in `elrond-wasm`:
	- `alloc` allows contracts to use the heap allocator. It is not a hard restriction, there is still access to the implementations of the heap-allocated types, but they are not imported. Some methods are only available with this flag.
	- `ei-1-1` allows contracts to use VM endpoints that are not yet available on the mainnet.
- Fixes with async calls, smart contract deploy & upgrade.
- Refactoring regarding small number types in the API.
- Rust testing framework: Allow checking NFT balance without also checking attributes.
- View for `MapMapper`.

## [elrond-wasm 0.29.3] - 2022-03-03

- Implemented `ManagedVecItem` for `Option<T>`.

## [elrond-wasm 0.29.2] - 2022-03-01
- Disabled git tag/commit info in ABI due to issue in standard modules.

## [elrond-wasm 0.29.0] - 2022-03-01
- Cleaned up allocator from modules: `DnsModule`, `EsdtModule`, `FeaturesModule`, `PauseModule`, `UsersModule`.
- Crypto API managed wrapper over legacy VM endpoints.
- Managed multi-value types refactor and rename.
- `ManagedVec` - `remove`, `contains`, `find`.
- `ManagedVecItem` derive for simple enums.

- Git tag/commit info in ABI.

## [elrond-wasm 0.28.0, elrond-codec 0.9.0, mandos 0.12.0] - 2022-02-22
- Major elrond-codec refactor:
	- Redesigned the error handling for single value encoding
	- Introduced multi-value encoding, which replaces the previous endpoint argument and result mechanisms
- Mandos improvements:
	- Multi-values: out, topics, ESDT uri
	- Logs "+" wildcard
- Builtin function mocks: `ESDTNFTUpdateAttributes`, `ESDTNFTAddURI`
- New storage mappers: `FungibleTokenMapper`, `NonFungibleTokenMapper`, `WhitelistMapper`
- Call value wrapper avoids using invalid token index in requests

## [elrond-wasm 0.27.4, elrond-codec 0.8.5] - 2022-02-02
- Backwards compatibility fix.

## [elrond-wasm 0.27.3] - 2022-01-31
- Backwards compatibility fix.

- Added missing non-specialized decode implementations for managed types.

## [elrond-wasm 0.27.1] - 2022-01-27
- Deriving `PartialEq` now works on structs that contain managed types.

## [elrond-wasm 0.27.0] - 2022-01-25
- Fixed certain compilation error messages. The previous implementation of the macro preprocessor would have concealed the location of many issues.
- Changed implementation of `require!`:
	- `require!` no longer returns a `SCResult` type, when the condition is false it now stops the transaction immediately, via `signal_error`;
	- `require!` now accepts message formatting;
	- `require_old!` gives access to the old implementation.
- The Rust testing framework can now handle panics and async calls.
- ABI bugfix - an issue regarding nested types.

- Refactored `CodeMetadata` and added "payable by SC" field.
- Empty contract template.

## [elrond-wasm 0.26.0] - 2022-01-19
- Major VM API trait refactoring. All API methods can be accessed from a static context. Removed api instance variables from all objects.
- External view contracts
	- Annotating one or more endpoints with `#[external_view]` triggers the framework to create a second "external view" contract where all these endpoints are placed. This is primarily to reduce the main contract size.
	- General `meta` crate functionality refactor to allow multiple contract generation.
- `ManagedRef` type
	- Provided as a more efficient alternative to regular references to managed types
	- Has `Copy` semantics

## [elrond-wasm 0.19.0, elrond-codec 0.6.0, mandos 0.9.0] - 2021-09-10
- Managed types used extensively. Because of this, the recommended Arwen minimum version is `v1.4.10`.
	- Redesigned parts of the elrond-codec, so as to allow custom type specializations. These specializations allow serializers and types to bypass the limitations of the codec traits to provide optimized implementations. Managed type serialization relies on this.
	- Redesigned existing managed types: `BigInt`, `BigUint`, `EllipticCurve`.
	- Added the `ManagedBuffer` type, which can be used to store anything on the VM side.
	- Support for complex operations using managed buffers, such as storing lists of elements in a managed buffer via the `ManagedVec` type.
	- There are `ManagedAddress`es now. They rely on another managed type, the `ManagedByteArray`, which is a fixed size managed structure.
	- `TokenIdentifier` is now a managed type.
	- Serializer based on a managed buffer.
	- Storage keys are now based on managed buffers.
	- All error messages generated by the framework are assembled using a managed buffer.
	- The blockchain API uses managed types for most interactions.
	- The contract call API uses managed types for most interactions.
	- The call value API supports multi transfer via managed `EsdtTokenPayment` objects.
	- Event logs are sent to the VM via managed types (`ManagedVec<ManagedBuffer>` for topics, `ManagedBuffer` for data).
	- Type conversion traits for managed types: `ManagedFrom` and `ManagedInto`.
	- There are now 2 types of `SCError`: `StaticSCError` for static messages and `ManagedSCError`, which is backed by a managed buffer.
	- Contract errors can now be triggered immediately, without the need to return them from an endpoint.
- Improved macro preprocessor: more complex patterns can now be substituted.
	- Generic API parameter needs not be specified every time.
	- Substitutions available for most managed types and storage mappers.
- Separated contract API into low-level VM API connectors and high-level utility objects to be used in the contracts.
- Mandos-rs improvements:
	- Self tests synchronized with mandos-go. Some missing features needed to be added to make them pass.
	- Support for ESDT tokens.
	- Support for ESDT multi-transfer.


## [elrond-wasm 0.18.2] - 2021-08-20
- Crypto API: `ripemd160` function, custom secp256k1 signature verification (`verify_custom_secp256k1`) and signature generation (`encode_secp256k1_der_signature`).

## [elrond-wasm 0.18.1] - 2021-08-05

## [elrond-wasm 0.16.0, mandos 0.7.0, elrond-codec 0.5.3] - 2021-05-14
### Major redesign of important framework components:
- The arguments to contract/module/proxy annotations are gone. All items are generated in the same Rust module. Both submodule inclusion and contract calls are now Rust-module-aware.
- Submodule imports are now expressed as supertraits instead of the module getter annotated methods. Note: explicitly specifying the Rust module is required, in order for the framework to fetch generated types and functions from that module.
- Each contract now generates its own callable proxy to ease calling it. Caller contracts do no longer need to define a call interface, they can import it from the crate of the contract they want to call. Callable proxies contain the methods from the main contract, as well as from all the modules. Note: calling a contract requires the caller to specify the Rust module where it resides.
- We no longer have a separate syntax/parser/code generation for call proxies. They are just contracts with no implementations and annotated with `#[elrond_wasm_derive::proxy]` instead of `#[elrond_wasm_derive::contract]`.
- BigUint and BigInt are now associated types instead of generics in all API traits. Contracts need to specify them as `Self::BigUint` instead of just `BigUint`. Although more verbose, this might be more intuitive for the developer.
- `ContractCall`s, `AsyncCall`s and all other call & transfer result types now contain a reference to the Send API. This also means the `execute_on_dest_context` method no longer requires an api argument.
- `execute_on_dest_context` can now deserialize the call results automatically and provide them to the calling contract. There is a mechanism in place to deconstruct non-serialized types, e.g. `SCResult<T>` becomes `T` and `AsyncCall<Self::BigUint>` becomes `()`. 
- Callbacks and callback proxies needed to be adapted to the new system, but work similar to how they did in the past.
- Contracts can define proxy getter methods using the `#[proxy]` annotation.
- Callbacks can now have names, just like endpoints. This name gets saved in the callback closure in storage, but has no other impact on the contract. The reason I needed it was to help me with defining callback forwarders and avoiding some name collisions there. Callback forwarders are still needed for a little longer, until module callbacks are properly implemented.

### Mandos
- mandos-rs syntax synchronized with mandos-go (`sc:` syntax, new ESDT call value syntax, _no NFTs yet_).

## [elrond-wasm 0.15.1] - 2021-04-30

    	- `#[payment]` argument attribute now also provides ESDT payment where applicable
    	- a new TokenIdentifier type that encodes the EGLD special token and any ESDT token
    	- a new `#[token_identifier]` argument attribute provides the token id. Similar to `#[payment]` it is a fake argument, not exported.
    	- ABI updated ("payableInTokens" is no longer restricted to "EGLD")
    	- all new features covered by mandos tests
    	- async proxies still only accept `#[payable("EGLD")]`, but that is for future updates
	- Less visible changes:
    	- all call value hooks now grouped in a new CallValueApi
    	- for low-level access, developers now need to write self.call_value().egld_value(), etc.
    	- some optimizations in the handling of call value hooks
	- Refactoring:
    	- parse_attr mod was split into a proper folder with many files, since it had grown too large

# Linear Function

The logic is 

`ax + b  = y`

where: 

- x - `issued token`
- y - `exchanging token`
- a - `linear_coefficient`
- b - `initial_price` of the token (in the role of the constant coefficient)

Because of selling n tokens at a time, the total price y' will be
`a* (nx + (n - 1) n / 2) + nb = y'`

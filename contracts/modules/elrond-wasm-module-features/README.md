# Elrond smart contract module for adding feature flags

This is a standard smart contract module, that when added to a smart contract offers feature flag capabilities.

It offers:
* an endpoint where the owner can turn features on/off
* a method to check if feature is on or not
* a macro to make calling this method even more compact

# Releases explained

These are the release descriptions that are going up on [the MultiversX releases page](https://multiversx.com/releases/wasm)

They are committed here for easier handling, to avoid having them lost in private messages.


## Workflow

Developers should also add descriptions here after performing releases.

Then, whoever is responsible with the public releases web page should add them to [the MultiversX releases page](https://multiversx.com/releases/wasm) as well.

Unfortunately, developers do not have direct access there, nor is it currently possible to automate the upload.


## Important!

This folder does not in any way replace [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md).

The changelog remains the source of truth regarding release history and features launched.

The information contained herein is secondary, written for a wider audience, and only contains selected expained features and highlights.
